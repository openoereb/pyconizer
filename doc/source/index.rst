   faq

``pyconizer`` is an open-source implementation. It helps to create legend symbols as images and SVG out of a
WMS request.

It is written in Python as a pip installable package.

Architecture
------------

The package provides several abstraction layers to use for icon creation. There are high level ones as well
as real low level ones like parsing a SLD to objects. However the support of creating SVG is in a really
early development state for now.
